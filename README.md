***Sam***
RobinHood uses a no fees structure and very low interest rates to make trading more attractive to customers. They also are using an app to reach more customers at a time which is also more attractive to millennials. Theyre considered a FinTech company because they are disrupting the finnacial markets with new technogology (an app rather than a website). RobinHood doesnt just trade in stocks but also etfs, stock options, and cryptocurrencies. RobinHood makes profit very much like a bank.

Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
***JFK***
Robinhood is exemplary in the Fintech space because it is allows individual users to access the trading platform via mobile app compared to more traditional trading platforms that required a PC or have a broker to make trades.  It has a competitive advantage compared to traditional trading houses because it has minimal overhead costs and personnel eliminating the need for minimal account balances and $0 commission trades.  It does have vulnerabilities since it does not have minimal requirements or trade commissions, the Company has minimal margin for covering trades until settlement.
