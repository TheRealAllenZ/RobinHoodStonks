***Sam***
RobinHood uses a no fees structure and very low interest rates to make trading more attractive to customers. They also are using an app to reach more customers at a time which is also more attractive to millennials. Theyre considered a FinTech company because they are disrupting the finnacial markets with new technogology (an app rather than a website). RobinHood doesnt just trade in stocks but also etfs, stock options, and cryptocurrencies. RobinHood makes profit very much like a bank.
